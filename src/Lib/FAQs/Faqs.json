		"question": "How long does an average project take?",
		"answer": "A web design and build project can last around 12-14 weeks, whereas brand into web and marketing deliverables into a launch campaign can take 6 months or more. There are always ways to consider business objectives (such as phased launches) so even if your timescales don’t work with this, it’s always worth reaching out."

		"question": "Can you start straight away?",
		"answer": "The start of the project can often involve work on the client side to get into an agreement, gather data and begin answering questionnaires. There will also be general onboarding such as project management and the project schedule. We will also have an internal kick-off to ensure the team is aligned. The client kick-off is the first milestone, and this is often anywhere from 2-4 weeks from the signed agreement."

		"answer": "We deliberately adapt and change our portfolio to keep our website exciting and relevant.\n\nOver 9 years we have been fortunate to work with a range of sectors and brands over both B2B and B2C. We pride ourselves on not being focused on one industry and bringing our experience from multiple industries to each brief. This is something that sets KOTA apart."
